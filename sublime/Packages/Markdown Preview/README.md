Sublime Text 2/3 Markdown Preview
=================================

Preview your markdown files quickly in you web browser from sublime text 2/3. 

You can use builtin [python-markdown][10] parser or use the [github markdown API][5] for the conversion.

**NOTE:** If you choose the GitHub API for conversion (set parser: github in your settings), your code will be sent through https to github for live conversion. You'll have [Github flavored markdown][6], syntax highlighting and EMOJI support for free :heart: :octocat: :gift:. If you make more than 60 calls a day, be sure to set your GitHub API key in the settings :)

**LINUX users:** If you want to use GitHub API for conversion, you'll need to have a custom Python install that includes python-ssl as its not built in the Sublime Text 2 Linux package. see [@dusteye comment][8]. If you use a custom window manager, also be sure to set a `BROWSER` environnement variable. see [@PPvG comments][9]

## Features :
